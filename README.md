# Would You Rather Project

This is the final project of redux section in react nano-degree from Udacity

# Project Overview

In the "Would You Rather?" Project, I built a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

In my app, users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leader-board.

# How To Run The Project

2 . cd to the project folder

3 . use (npm i) to install all dependencies

4 . use (npm start) to start the project
